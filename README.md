# Stock_Sentiment_Analysis

In this module, I used Randomforest algorithm to classify the future stock movements of a company based on the top 25 headlines.

The data set used in this module is : CombinedNewsDJIA.csv

This combined dataset has 27 columns.The first column is "Date", the second is "Label", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from "Top1" to "Top25".

As for label:

0 indicates that the headlines had no influence on that stock price on that particular day.

1 indicates that the headlines had influence and caused movement on the stock price on that particular day.

The goal is to predict the movement of the stock based on the top 25 headlines.
